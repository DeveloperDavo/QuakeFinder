# Quake Finder

This is a simple app that displays a list of earthquakes from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. 
The user is able to choose between "all" or "significant" earthquakes that have happened in the past day. 
After clicking an item in the list the user is re-directed to the USGS website which shows detailed information about the chosen earthquake.
